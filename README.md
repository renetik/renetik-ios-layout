# Renetik iOS Layout

## About
Write complex reliable layouts easy, 
by using declarative readable syntax and pure code approach. 
This way you never has to rewrite your layout again using other whatever way to do it. 
Its always compatible because it is based on basic UIKit underlying technology. 
You don't need to learn new artificial paradigms to solve the same puzzle 
by different methods all over again, 
just get better in real programming and focus on your task, 
not new ways of doing things that distract you from making great products.
